# Payment Service

## Overview
The Payment Service handles all payment processing operations in the Blue Zone e-commerce platform. It processes payments, manages payment methods, handles refunds, and integrates with external payment gateways. Currently implements a simulation layer for workshop purposes.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… What's Already Implemented
- **Basic Payment Processing**: Simulated payment processing with 80% success rate
- **Payment Models**: JPA entities for Payment, PaymentStatus, and PaymentMethod
- **Kafka Integration**: 
  - Listens to order events for automatic payment creation
  - Publishes payment events (completed, failed, refunded)
- **Repository Layer**: Spring Data JPA repositories
- **Service Layer**: Payment processing with simulation logic
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Automatic payment processing when orders are created

### ðŸ”§ Current Payment Flow
1. Order created â†’ Kafka event â†’ Payment automatically created
2. Payment processed with 80% success simulation
3. Payment status updated â†’ Kafka event published
4. Supports payment refunds

### ðŸ’³ Supported Payment Methods (Enum)
- CREDIT_CARD
- DEBIT_CARD  
- PAYPAL
- BANK_TRANSFER
- APPLE_PAY
- GOOGLE_PAY

### ðŸ“Š Payment Status States
- PENDING â†’ PROCESSING â†’ COMPLETED/FAILED
- COMPLETED â†’ REFUNDED (for refund flow)

- Kafka integration tests for event handling
- Security tests for fraud detection
- Performance tests for high-volume scenarios

## ðŸ“‹ Environment Setup

### Required Dependencies (already configured)

```yaml
payment:
  stripe:
    public-key: ${STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY}
    secret-key: ${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}
  paypal:
    client-id: ${PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID}
    client-secret: ${PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET}
  fraud-detection:
    enabled: true
    max-attempts: 3
```

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points

### Incoming Dependencies
- **Order Service**: Order events via Kafka
- **Frontend**: Payment method management

### Outgoing Dependencies
- **External Payment Gateways**: Stripe, PayPal
- **Notification Service**: Payment status notifications
- **Kafka**: Payment event publishing

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Current Security Gaps (to be addressed in assignments)
- Payment data is not encrypted
- No fraud detection mechanisms
- No rate limiting on payment attempts
- Missing PCI compliance measures
- No 3D Secure authentication

### Security Requirements to Implement
- PCI DSS compliance
- Payment data encryption at rest and in transit
- Fraud detection and prevention
- Secure payment method tokenization
- Audit logging for all payment operations

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Payment gateway integration patterns
- Financial data security and encryption
- Fraud detection algorithms
- Event-driven payment processing
- Multi-currency and international payments
- Payment industry standards and compliance
